# basic cpp self practice
This mini-project was undertaken as a self-practice exercise.
The project definition and tasks were adapted from an old "Introduction to Software Systems" course in the Technion.
You may notice in places odd code implementations (like initiating an array of pointers in studen.h class, and not using a vevtor).
This is intentional, as the code was tailored to meet the specific requirements of given tests. It may not necessarily represent optimal solutions for general user scenarios.
*Note For Self* - Run more tests, check for memory leaks.
